RSA-Factoring is an attack against the RSA public-key cryptosystem that aims to factorize the modulus (N) into its prime factors (p and q). The security of RSA relies on the assumption that factoring large numbers into their prime factors is a difficult problem, and therefore, it is computationally infeasible to determine the private key from the public key.

RSA-Factoring involves finding the two prime numbers (p and q) that multiply to form the modulus (N). Once p and q are known, it is relatively easy to calculate the private key and decrypt any message encrypted using the corresponding public key.

The best-known classical algorithm for factoring large integers is the General Number Field Sieve (GNFS), which is a complex and time-consuming process. However, advancements in quantum computing have shown that it may be possible to factor large numbers much faster than classical algorithms can. This means that RSA-Factoring could become a serious threat to the security of RSA if large-scale quantum computers become available in the future.
